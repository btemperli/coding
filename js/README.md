# Writing JavaScript

Our guidelines are based on the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript). There are two 
variantes of the styleguide. The most recent version of the style guide uses [ECMAScript 6](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features).
This is what we're using in all projects wherever possible.

The Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide provides a version for [ECMAScript 5](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/es5).
For projects where using ES6 is absolutely not possible, we adhere to this style guide.
